bootstrap
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap)

Bootstrap a system (many distributions) to be managed by Ansible, likely the first role to depend on. This role does not depend on other roles, but many others may depend on this role.

This role installs required software to be able to run all ansible packaged modules.

A benefit is that this role prepares nearly any (Linux) system, including:
- Alpine
- ArchLinux
- Busybox
- CentOS
- Debian
- Fedora
- FreeBSD
- Gentoo
- Red Hat
- OpenSUSE
- Ubuntu


Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/default/playbook.yml`:
```
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  become: true

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap

  tasks:
    - name: test connection
      ping:

```

Role Variables
--------------

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```
---
# defaults file for bootstrap

# The user to use to connect to machines.
bootstrap_user: root

# Installed software to support modules flagged as "preview" (i.e. mysql_db).
# "yes", "no" or unset are valid.
bootstrap_preview: yes

# Do you want to wait for the host to be available?
bootstrap_wait_for_host: no

# To update all packages installed by this roles, set `bootstrap_package_state` to `latest`.
bootstrap_package_state: present

```
